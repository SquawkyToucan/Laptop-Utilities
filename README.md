# Laptop-Utilities
Here are some (and soon to be coming) utilities for your laptop (or desktop), for people whose computers don't have them. Have fun!
- Calculator
   A basic calculator for cracking those simple equations and busting that stupid subtraction problem that you can never get.
   FUTURE UPDATES (hopefully):
   - Typing ability
   - Better +/- response
   
   
   
   
More projects I'll probably add to the project:
- Unit Converter
And Stuff I Probably Won't Add:
- Stock Ticker (I'd love to try)
